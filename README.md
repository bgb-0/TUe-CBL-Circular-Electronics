# :recycle: Prototype Audio PCB for TU/e 4CBLW00-11 course
This repository contains the PCB design files (KiCad 9), schematic, and 3D model image
for a prototype modular bluetooth audio board, based on te ESP32-Mini-1 module.
This is a prototype PCB designed for a modular bluetooth speaker, for the Multidisciplinary CBL (4CBLW00) course of year 2024/2025, made possible with help from Darije Caic.
Design includes a ESP32-Mini chipset that functions as a Bluetooth A2DP sink, which uses the built-in DAC to p
